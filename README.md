# the showcase

### $\rightarrow$ The entire point of this site is to show what I am learning and what I can do.

That is why the design is very simple and I used javascript as less as I could, stole design ideas and thought of a few of my own.

You are free to copy anything and everything from this repo without any issue.

Also yes - AI has been used here to automate the mundane stuff, I really do dislike CSS but also having a website is kinda neat.
